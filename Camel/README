To compile a version of Camel 3.18.1 with the extra logging, download its source and setup Maven etc

Then place the two files in ./components/camel-jms/... in the same place in the Camel source tree

Camel 3.18.1 compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 with Java 11.0.16

You may need to comment out the <module>docs</module> line in the master Camel pom.xml

See the log4j2.properties file in the CamelRouter app to see how log msgs are written
DEBUG level will output the propertyNames array of every message while INFO will only log messages with problems
