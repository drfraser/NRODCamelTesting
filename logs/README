These files are log files containing examples of the errors seen.

So far, propertyNames array has been one of these:

A. null

B. [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 14, 116, 114, 97, 110, 115, 102, 111, 114, 109, 97, 116, 105, 111, 110, 9, 0, 7, 106, 109, 115, 45, 120, 109, 108]

C. [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 14, 116, 114, 97, 110, 115, 102, 111, 114, 109, 97, 116, 105, 111, 110, 9, 0, 7, 106, 109, 115, 45, 120, 109, 108]

D. [0, 0, 0, 1]

The first four bytes are the number of properties in the array, then a UTF-8 string (2 byte length first), then its value (byte for the type, then the data)

In B and C, the property is "transformation" and the value "jms-xml"

The C and D variants will cause ActiveMQ to throw an exception.
